<p>
    Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi in North American, British and continental European English) or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.[1][2] The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward')[3] is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg. It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour.
    Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China.The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to the 12th century during the Song dynasty.[4] In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred. The fruit became popular with British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II, and later became commonly exported, first to Great Britain and then to California in the 1960s.

<h2 id="beta">History of the Kiwi</h2>
  <p>
    Early varieties were described in a 1904 nursery catalogue as having "...edible fruits the size of walnuts, and the flavour of ripe gooseberries",[6] leading to the name Chinese gooseberry.[1] In 1962, New Zealand growers began calling it "kiwifruit" (Māori: huakiwi)[7] due to its fuzzy appearance similar to the kiwi bird[8] for export marketing, and the name was first registered by Turners & Growers on 15 June 1959[8] and later commercially adopted in 1974.[1] In New Zealand and Australia, the word "kiwi" alone either refers solely to the bird or is used as a nickname for New Zealanders; it is almost never used to refer to the fruit.[5][9] Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown green kiwifruit from the genus Actinidia.[1] In the United States and Canada, the shortened name kiwi is commonly used when referring to the fruit.[10][11]
